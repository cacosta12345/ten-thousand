# Chatgpt 4 Q&A

## Prompt 1: 

* I'm making a project in python that does the ten thousand dice game. These are the directions I have to follow: 
Then I copied and pasted the features and requirements section of the lab.
I also have these tests I have to pass. Test file 1: 
Then I pasted the test_calculate_score.py
Test file 2:
Then I pasted the test_roll_dice.py

## Answer 1: 

* Code with 40 + failing tests

## Prompt 2: 
* I ran the tests and I'm failing these tests.
Then I copied the whole test from the terminal including all fails and passes and pasted it

## Answer 2: 
* The test failures indicate an issue with the scoring logic in your calculate_score method, particularly for cases involving multiples of the same number (e.g., four of a kind, five of a kind, six of a kind). The pattern of failures suggests that the score calculation for these scenarios is incorrectly doubled for each additional die beyond three.
* And it gave me revised code with potential fixes.

## Prompt 3-5
* Same as prompt 2. It would pass a few more and I would paste the failures to gpt and it would give me more code to test. It eventually got them all passing

## Prompt: 
* All the tests passed! Thanks chatgpt

## Answer 3: 
* You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that all the tests passed. Great job on working through the challenges and getting your Python project to a successful state. If you have any more questions, whether about this project or anything else, feel free to ask. Happy coding!
